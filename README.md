This project uses visual recognition and machine learning to recognise alphabet letters in Indian Sign Language (ISL). It develops a RandomForestClassifier on an archive of data of hand movements and using MediaPipe to recognise hand landmarks in real time from camera input. The model detects motions and displays the associated ISL symbols on the video feed, enabling applications such as ISL learning tools, motion interactions, and accessibility features.
